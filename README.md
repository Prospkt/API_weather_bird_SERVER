# API_weather_bird_SERVER

It was used - javascript, a little of html, node 
Also played a little with Postman to understand API parameters 


This app basically gets an user request for a city  - from a html form  - which is posted and substituted as a parameter calling an API from a weather forecast, as a response 
it will show description, temperature and an icon relared to that requested city weather forecast.  Its cute !
